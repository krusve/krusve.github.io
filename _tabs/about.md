## About myself

My name is Sven-Christian Kruse, I am currently in my final year of Softwareengineering and IT Security, but work in the Security field and intend to keep going in that direction.

I am using most of my time for studies and work but do find the time for TryHackMe, playing around with Raspberry Pi or any other random obsession, such as Quantum Computing with Qiskit.

I'll be using this blog for Walkthroughs, interesting topics and projects.
