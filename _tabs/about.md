# About myself and this blog

My name is Sven-Christian Kruse, I am currently in my final year of Softwareengineering and IT Security, but work in the Security field and intend to keep going in that direction.

I am using most of my time for studies and work but do find the time for TryHackMe, playing around with Raspberry Pi or any other random obsession, such as Quantum Computing with Qiskit.

I'll be using this blog for Walkthroughs, interesting topics and projects.

## My road thus far

Having finished Highschool at 18, I, as many before me, did not know what exactly to do, so I threw myself into studying Business and Economics, which I knew would open many doors and provide a stable and promising future. However, about two years into the Degree, I realized that it might not be my cup of tea for the long run. I did not want to spend the next, perhaps decades, as a middle-man in a giant financial system*.<sub>*Slight exaggeration but you get the gist</sub> <br />
**I wanted to have a more direct impact**.
At this point, I set my mind on studying something I would find more purpose in, but because I now was only one year away from finishing the Bachelor's Degree, I decided to finish it. Studying Business and Economics has provided me with incredible insight, and I still carry a passion for both economics and finance. However, I mostly live it through reading and investing.

Throughout my Business and Economics degree, I had become involved with the Data Science Club, which gave me my first exposure to programming and an introduction to computer science. A fascination evolved, and so I was looking for Computer Science and Software Engineering degrees. I finally decided on softwareengineering and IT Security.

The IT Security focus allowed me to take a lot of interesting classes. Additionally, I'm working in IT Security, so my focus is heavily on IT Security and less software engineering, which I enjoy. **This orientation has awoken a deep interest and passion for the field of IT Security**, and I am following a path that will lead me further into it. Whether that will be through Certificates or perhaps a Master's degree, I haven't decided yet.
